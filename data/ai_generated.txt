{
  "Executive Summary": "The ODOO ERP Custom Development Project aims to enhance ODOO Community Version 17 through two primary custom add-ons developed by a team of seven intern students. The first feature integrates OAuth authentication with Google and Facebook providers to streamline the login process. The second feature augments ODOO's group chat functionality with an AI assistant (OdooAI) that can participate in conversations based on specific triggers and context awareness. This project serves not only to deliver valuable enhancements to the ODOO platform but also as a professional development opportunity for the interns to gain practical experience in collaborative software development, research, group management, and portfolio building.",
  
  "Problem Statement": "Organizations using ODOO Community Version 17 face two significant challenges. First, users need to maintain separate login credentials for ODOO rather than leveraging existing social media accounts, creating friction in the user experience. Second, ODOO's built-in group chat functionality lacks intelligent assistance capabilities that could streamline communication and provide contextual help to users. Additionally, intern students require practical, hands-on experience working on real-world software development projects that will prepare them for future professional responsibilities.",
  
  "Target Users": "The primary target users for this project include:\n\n1. **ODOO System Users** - Employees and stakeholders who will benefit from streamlined login processes and enhanced communication tools\n\n2. **System Administrators** - IT professionals who manage ODOO implementations and need simplified authentication management\n\n3. **Development Team** - Seven intern students who will gain valuable experience in ERP customization, modern authentication protocols, and AI integration\n\n4. **Team Leaders and Managers** - Who will benefit from the AI-assisted communication features to improve team collaboration and efficiency\n\n5. **Third-party System Integrators** - Engineers who will connect ODOO with external systems and benefit from standardized authentication protocols",
  
  "Product Goals": "The goals for this ODOO enhancement project are to:\n\n1. Simplify the user authentication process by integrating social login options with Google and Facebook\n\n2. Enhance team communication by adding an AI assistant to group chats that can provide contextual responses\n\n3. Create a modular and maintainable codebase following ODOO development best practices\n\n4. Provide the intern development team with practical experience in ERP customization, OAuth integration, and AI implementation\n\n5. Establish a foundation for future enhancements including AI personalization, system control, and third-party integrations\n\n6. Reduce administrative overhead by streamlining the user onboarding process",
  
  "Requirements & Features": "## 1. OAuth Integration\n\n- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow that integrates with ODOO's existing authentication system\n- Support Google and Facebook as OAuth providers\n- Ensure secure token handling and user profile mapping\n- Maintain backward compatibility with existing login mechanisms\n- Implement appropriate error handling and fallback authentication methods\n- Add administrative controls for enabling/disabling specific OAuth providers\n- Provide user interface for linking existing ODOO accounts with social profiles\n\n## 2. OdooAI Chat Assistant\n\n- Enhance ODOO's group chat functionality to include an AI assistant\n- Implement the following OdooAI participation triggers:\n  * Explicit invitation to a group by a user\n  * Messages sent in a group without specific user mentions\n  * Direct mentions of OdooAI or mentions of everyone (@OdooAI or @everyone)\n- Implement non-participation logic when messages only mention specific users without including OdooAI\n- Enable access to chat history and topic context for the AI assistant\n- Design a modular architecture that allows for future enhancements\n- Include message context awareness to provide relevant responses\n- Implement rate limiting and usage monitoring for AI service consumption",
  
  "User Stories": "### OAuth Integration\n\n1. As a user, I want to log in to ODOO using my Google account so that I don't need to remember another set of credentials.\n2. As a user, I want to log in to ODOO using my Facebook account so that I can access the system quickly without creating new credentials.\n3. As a system administrator, I want to enable/disable specific OAuth providers so that I can control authentication options based on company policy.\n4. As a user, I want to link my existing ODOO account to my social media login so that I maintain my user preferences and access rights.\n5. As a security administrator, I want the OAuth integration to follow security best practices so that user data remains protected.\n6. As a new user, I want to automatically create an ODOO account when logging in with my social media account for the first time.\n\n### OdooAI Chat Assistant\n\n1. As a team member, I want to invite OdooAI to my group chat so that I can get AI assistance during team discussions.\n2. As a chat participant, I want OdooAI to respond when I don't mention anyone specific so that I can get general assistance without explicitly calling the AI.\n3. As a team member, I want to directly mention OdooAI in a message so that I can get targeted help on specific questions.\n4. As a user, I expect OdooAI to not interject when I'm directly conversing with another team member so that human conversations aren't interrupted.\n5. As a new group member, I want OdooAI to be aware of previous conversation context so that its responses are relevant to ongoing discussions.\n6. As a system administrator, I want to monitor and limit the AI service usage to manage costs effectively.",
  
  "Technical Requirements": "### System Requirements\n- ODOO Community Version 17\n- Python 3.8+\n- PostgreSQL database\n- Development and testing environments with internet access\n- HTTPS-enabled web server for secure authentication\n- Domain with valid SSL certificate\n\n### OAuth Integration\n- OAuth 2.0 libraries compatible with Python/ODOO\n- Secure storage for client secrets and tokens\n- API access configuration for Google and Facebook developer accounts\n- HTTPS for secure token transmission\n- JWT token validation and secure storage mechanisms\n- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection\n\n### OdooAI Integration\n- Integration with a suitable LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, or a self-hosted solution)\n- Message parsing system to detect mentions and triggers\n- Context management system for chat history access\n- Response generation system with appropriate business rules\n- Token/usage management for AI service costs\n- Caching mechanism to improve response time and reduce API calls\n- Rate limiting to prevent excessive usage\n\n### Development Tools\n- Version control system (Git)\n- ODOO development environment\n- Testing framework for unit and integration tests\n- Documentation system for project artifacts\n- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment",
  
  "Architecture": "The architecture for the ODOO custom addons will follow ODOO's modular development patterns:\n\n### OAuth Integration Module\n1. **Authentication Controller**: Handles OAuth flow redirects and callbacks\n2. **Provider Management**: Configurable settings for OAuth providers\n3. **User Mapping Service**: Maps external user profiles to ODOO user accounts\n4. **Token Management**: Securely handles access and refresh tokens\n5. **Session Integration**: Integrates with ODOO's session management\n6. **Security Layer**: Implements protection against common OAuth vulnerabilities\n\n### OdooAI Chat Module\n1. **Message Listener**: Intercepts and analyzes group chat messages\n2. **Trigger Detector**: Determines when OdooAI should participate\n3. **Context Collector**: Gathers relevant conversation history\n4. **AI Client**: Communicates with the LLM API\n5. **Response Formatter**: Formats AI responses for the chat interface\n6. **Group Management**: Handles OdooAI invitation/removal from groups\n7. **Usage Monitor**: Tracks and limits API usage\n\nBoth modules will be developed as standard ODOO addons with proper separation of concerns, following the MVC pattern, and utilizing ODOO's ORM for database operations. The modular design ensures each component is independently testable and allows for future extensions without impacting core functionality.",
