  "Executive Summary": "The ODOO ERP Custom Development Project aims to enhance ODOO Community Version 17 with two specialized addons: OAuth authentication for streamlined login via Google and Facebook, and an AI assistant (OdooAI) for intelligent group chat interactions. Developed by a team of seven intern students, this project serves as both a practical enhancement to ODOO functionality and a professional development opportunity. With a timeline of 1.5 months starting April 22, 2025, the project balances technical innovation with educational objectives to deliver secure, user-friendly extensions that improve authentication workflows and team communication.",
  
  "Problem Statement": "Organizations using ODOO Community Version 17 face two key challenges that impact user experience and productivity. First, users must maintain separate ODOO credentials rather than utilizing existing social accounts, creating unnecessary friction during authentication. Second, the platform's group chat functionality lacks intelligent assistance capabilities that could provide contextual help, answer questions, and streamline communication. Additionally, intern students require real-world project experience that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application in a collaborative environment to prepare them for professional roles in software development.",

  "Technical Requirements": "### System Requirements\n- ODOO Community Version 17\n- Python 3.8+\n- PostgreSQL database\n- HTTPS-enabled web server with valid SSL certificate\n- Internet access for OAuth and LLM API calls\n- Development, testing, and production environments\n\n### OAuth Integration\n- OAuth 2.0 compatible libraries for Python/ODOO\n- Secure token storage implementation\n- Google & Facebook developer accounts and API credentials\n- JWT token validation mechanisms\n- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection\n- User profile mapping and synchronization\n\n### OdooAI Integration\n- LLM API access (OpenAI, Anthropic, or self-hosted solution)\n- Message parsing and analysis system\n- Mention detection algorithms\n- Context collection and management\n- Response generation and formatting\n- Usage tracking and rate limiting\n- Caching for performance optimization\n\n### Development Environment\n- Version control system (Git)\n- CI/CD pipeline for testing\n- Documentation tools\n- Testing frameworks for unit and integration tests\n- Code quality and security scanning tools",
  
  "Architecture": "The architecture follows ODOO's modular approach, with two primary custom addons:\n\n### OAuth Integration Module\n\n**Components:**\n1. **Authentication Controller** - Manages OAuth redirects, callbacks, and authentication flow\n2. **Provider Configuration** - Handles setup and management of OAuth providers\n3. **User Mapping Service** - Links external profiles to ODOO user accounts\n4. **Token Manager** - Securely handles OAuth tokens\n5. **Security Layer** - Implements protections against common OAuth vulnerabilities\n\n**Data Flow:**\n1. User initiates OAuth login → Authentication Controller redirects to provider\n2. Provider authenticates user → Returns authorization code\n3. Controller exchanges code for token → Token Manager stores securely\n4. User Mapping Service creates/finds user → Session created\n\n### OdooAI Chat Module\n\n**Components:**\n1. **Message Listener** - Monitors group chat messages\n2. **Trigger Detector** - Analyzes messages for AI participation criteria\n3. **Context Collector** - Gathers relevant conversation history\n4. **AI Client** - Interfaces with LLM API\n5. **Response Formatter** - Prepares AI responses for the chat interface\n6. **Usage Monitor** - Tracks and manages API consumption\n\n**Data Flow:**\n1. User sends message → Message Listener intercepts\n2. Trigger Detector analyzes for participation criteria\n3. If triggered, Context Collector gathers relevant history\n4. AI Client generates appropriate response\n5. Response Formatter integrates response into chat\n6. Usage Monitor records interaction",
